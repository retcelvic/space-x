# Project Overview

This project was developed as part of the Applied Data Science Capstone course by IBM.

## Project Goals

In this project, a data scientist role was simulated for a new rocket company called Space Y, which wants to compete with SpaceX. The main goal is to find out how much each rocket launch costs by collecting information about SpaceX and creating visual dashboards. Additionally, a machine learning model was trained to predict if SpaceX will reuse the first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket, using publicly available data.
