This project was developed during the Applied Data Science Capstone course by IBM. 

In the project, the role of a data scientist in a new rocket company, called Space Y, was simulated. 
The company aims to compete with SpaceX. 
The main objective is to determine the cost of each rocket launch by gathering information about SpaceX and creating dashboards. 
Additionally, a machine learning model is trained to predict whether SpaceX would reuse the first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket, using public data.
